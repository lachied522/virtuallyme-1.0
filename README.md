# VirtuallyMe

This was my first ever project. Before starting this project I only new basic Python (no Javascript) and had never made an app before.

It is a ChatGPT wrapper that lets users upload pieces of their own writing and then attempts to generate text in the same style as the user.

It is a WSGI app that serves a single vanilla JS file to a webpage built with Webflow ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I later wanted to add websearch functionality and realised I needed an ASGI app (see https://github.com/lachied522/virtuallyme-2.0)
